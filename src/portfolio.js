  description: `Hi, I am Andy, a passionate QA Automation Engineer and Indie Game Developer.
  Coding is not just a job but a personal mission that becomes my passion. Whether that is optimally hunting down bugs, automating processes,
  or exploring the underbelly of game development, I strive to improve myself.
  My vision is unique because it is creative and not limited to knowing only my job, because as a developer, I like to understand the developers job too and that always enhance my vision to make better tests, wheter automated or not.`,
